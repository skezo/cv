He is an exceptional digital marketer, with a deep understanding of how to employ the comprehensive marketing stack to drive success for his clients. Creative, conceptual, strategic and driven, Oliver has a wealth of technical knowledge and talent that he brings to bear on every project. He is tireless in his efforts, always up for a challenge, and a true pleasure to work with, especially under pressure.</blockquote><cite><h4>Dev Finley</h4><p class="small">Partner // Director of Business Development at Godfrey Q</p></cite></div></div><div class="section-item"><div class="quote"><blockquote>Oliver may well be a genius. I'm not sure, because I don't understand most of what he's capable of doing. Whenever we've had a seemingly-intractable technology challenge or absurd client request, Oliver simple made it all happen. I know it was never &quot;simple&quot;, but it seemed that way to me. Calm, cool and reserved, he is a totally refreshing and eminently capable performer.</blockquote><cite><h4>Patrick Godfrey</h4><p class="small">Founder and President, Godfrey Q</p></cite></div></div><div class="section-item"><div class="quote"><blockquote>I've worked with Oliver closely for almost five years and he is one of the most clear-headed person I've ever known. Amidst the pressures and rush in delivering marketing campaigns for clients, I can be rest assured that things get delivered right on brief and time. Oliver is always researching for innovative solutions for clients' briefs, proposing interesting ideas and driving the team to explore ways to pitch and deliver the idea. His hands-on approach to every campaign and approachable personality to every single team member will be a definitive asset to any organisation.</blockquote><cite><h4>Pauline Yoong</h4><p class="small">Regional Client Partner</p></cite></div></div><div class="section-item"><div class="quote"><blockquote>Oliver is a 5-tool player in the digital playing field. 
He's strategic, methodical, conceptual, creative, and disarmingly witty.

We worked together with the Symantec Asia team to build a B2B demand gen digital platform--and throughout, never failed to deliver work that worked, spot-on-- over and over again. 

Add him to your team... everyone will thank you... believe me, you'll thank me later.</blockquote><cite><h4>Scott Silverman</h4><p class="small">Contextual Communications</p></cite></div></div><div class="section-item"><div class="quote"><blockquote>Oliver is a walking and talking encyclopedia. I could practically ask him anything from best practices for digital to anything else that's totally random. He is 1/2 of the leadership figure of Godfrey Q Singapore and just like his counterpart, he leads by example. Oliver is highly productive, efficient and an unmatched problem solver. He lives and breathes codes and probably dream in binary too. As a boss, Oliver is extremely patient, and willing to impart his knowledge with anyone that is curious enough to know. As a Regional Digital Director, he is always pushing the team to explore new technology. I have learned so much about modern web as well as UX and UI design from working with him. It has been my utmost pleasure working with him.</blockquote><cite><h4>Risiandi Jiang</h4><p class="small">Integrated Art Director at Godfrey Q</p></cite></div></div></div></main></div><footer id="footer-wrapper"><div class="footer-content center"><h3>Want to make something great together? <span class="nowrap"><a href="mailto:oliver.dooley@gmail.com">Talk to me</a>.</span></h3><ul class="list-inline small"><li>Singapore</li><li>+65 9759 6491</li><li><a href="mailto:oliver.dooley@gmail.com" target="_blank">oliver.dooley@gmail.com</a></li><li><a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/odooley" target="_blank">LinkedIn Profile <span class="icon icon--open_in_new"></span></a></li></ul></div></footer></body></html>
